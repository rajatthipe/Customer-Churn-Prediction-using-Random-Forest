# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Random-Forest

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a Random Forest classifier. 
Grid Search with Cross-Validation (GridSearchCV) is used to optimize hyperparameters and improve model performance. 
The project is implemented in Python and leverages libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

Key Libraries

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical computations.

scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.

matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.

Results

After training the model and optimizing hyperparameters, the Random Forest classifier achieves the following metrics:

Accuracy: 80%
